# Supervised Learning for Proxy Economic Harm Outcomes

This project aims to further analyze the data collected to construct the core metrics and validate the construction methodology. To further assess the efficacy of our economic harm metric, we evaluated our current features and weights. We implemented supervised learning models to predict two proxy economic harm outcomes: Number of initial claims per 100 people in the 2019 labor force and Percent change in number of small businesses open.
