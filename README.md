# Supervised Learning for Proxy Outcomes

To inform the next iteration of CVI metrics, we implemented supervised learning models to predict proxy outcomes. We sought to assess our current feature weights, quantify the predictive power of the included variables, and discover any information gaps in the initial metric construction. Please read the reports for background, results, and discussion.
